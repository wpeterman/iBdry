iBdry
=====

### R code and documentation to analyze data collected with iButton data loggers. This code will allow you to batch analyze .csv files created by iButton data loggers to determine inundation/dry dates of wetlands. A detailed manuscript describing the methods is currently in review.

* The "Instructions.docx" file contains detailed instructions of how to run the R code.
* iButtonFiles folder contains example iButton.csv files that can be analyzed using the code provided


### Future plans
* Make a user-friendly R package to implement code
* Implement a genetic algorithm to determine the optimal moving window and variance threshold to use during analysis
